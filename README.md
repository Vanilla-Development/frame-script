# Spoofing (ALL ON THE CLIENT SIDE, NOT SERVERSIDE)
## Here is everything that gets spoofed
1: Overhead Nametag

2: Display Name and Username in Killfeed, Escape Menu, Host Panel, Tablist, etc

3: Avatar Icon in Host panel, killfeed, and tablist

4: Avatar/Character

5: Displayed kit in tablist

6: Clan tag (creates the clantag attribute if helper account isnt in a clan)

If you need the AssetIds for all the current kits right now then check kits-table.json
If you want to change what kit you want to spoof then goto Avaliable and copy the exact name of the kit (only if you don't trust yourself with typing manually)
